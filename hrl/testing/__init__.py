HRL Testing Framework

This package contains a structured testing framework for the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning system.
It organizes tests into logical categories:

- opponents: Tests for evaluating trained models against different opponent strategies
- components: Tests for HRL components (options, policies, etc.)
- environment: Tests for environment functionality and coordination
- utils: Shared testing utilities and helpers

Run tests using the run_all_tests.py script in the root of this directory.
